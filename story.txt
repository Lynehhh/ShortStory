Today, I added a new file called story.txt

Nothing exciting is happening today.

Afterwards, I added this third line!

I also added this fourth line afterwards!

Fifth Line Woo!!!

I now added a monster into this story, so that it is exciting.

The monster is big and fat (but not scary, just spoopy)!

Turns out, the monster is friendly, because he is just cookie monster!
